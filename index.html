            <p class="lead"> Hello, my name is Michael Benefiel. I was born in Des Moines, Iowa, on January 27, 1986. I attended Iowa State University and graduated with a B.S. in Psychology and minor in Sociology.</p>
            <p class="lead">After college, I received a job working in Los Angeles. I worked as a transcriptions manager at a major film studio. I freelanced at several post production studios, as well. During my time in Los Angeles, I often worked on short films. Much of this was pro-bono work; however, I eventually turned them into paid gigs.</p>
            <p class="lead">After a few years working in the entertainment industry, I turned my focus towards a more steady career. That pursuit landed me in Washington, D.C., where I initially worked as a copy editor and transcriber for an internal news service. We covered Congressional hearings, etc. I started working on political campaigns after a year of living in DC. My first campaign was for an individual running for the Virginia House of Delegates (just like a state rep). We won the election, and I started to work as his legislative aide. I also worked on a US Senate race in Arizona during this time.</p>
            <p class="lead">For brevity's sake... A few years later I started working with the United Way. Fast forward some more, and I'm working as a government affairs director for a trade association in Kansas City. I'm currently a marketing manager with an insurance brokerage firm.</p>
            <p class="lead">During this time, I've acquired years of marketing, PR, communications and basic coding skills. I see my future in software engineering, web development or something similar. So here I am.</p>
